What are the limitations of the project?
-	the predicted “stolen years” are  based on the dataset of 2005, while the death data is from 2010 and 2013
-	the death data in 2013 is from the social media of Twitter
-	the death data includes the date and the location, but only showed in text instead of  graphs
-	some victims’ age of death is unknown in 2013 (grey curves)

Does it achieve everything it set out to?
No
-	the amount of curves is not visually accurate correlated to the percentage of victims unless it reaches the ratio less than 3%/97%

PROS:
-	showing floating text boxes for explanation when hovering over the graphs
	[4.png]
-	providing multiple combination of filters
	[5.png]
-	2 types of graphs(the interactive visualization & the curve chart) to show the data
	[6.png]	[7.png]
-	clicking the curve can lead to the link of the news of the death(some links are expired though)

CONS:
-	no legend to explain the gradient yellow color of curves (to make the overlapping curves legible)
	[8.png]
-	hard to compare the graphs among different filters to get further conclusion
-	using ambiguous words - “People Killed” & “Stolen Years” - cheat the readers   (2010 Homicide/ 2013 Suicide+Homicide)
