      <h1>ASSIGNMENT 02 - U.S. Gun Deaths</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="bio">
      <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> This project is trying to achieve an accurate depiction of the lives lost due to gun violence throughout the U.S, and the amount of years that each victim, and society, lost due to gun violence.The origin of the data for 2010 is the FBIâ€™s Uniform Crime Report, which utilizes data from police precincts from throughout the U.S that was voluntarily reported. This information includes the demographics (age, gender, race, relationship to killer, etc.) of the victims. The 2013 data was collected by the federal government, and also included Twitter data surrounding gun deaths. </p>

      <h3>What are the limitations of the project?</h3>
    		<ul>
    			<li>The predicted cumulative "stolen years"  are based on the dataset of 2005, whilethe death data is from 2010 and 2013.</li>
    			<li>The death data from 2013 is from Twitter; whereas other datasets were released from the federal government and is more reliable, the Twitter data is incomplete and possibly inaccurate. This is acknowledged in the "Sources and Methods" tab.</li>
    			<li>The death data includes the date and location, but it is presented only by text. No graphics are included.</li>
    			<li>The age of death for some victims is unknown:

    		</ul>

        <h3> Point of View </h3>
        <p> There is no overt point of view stated in the vizualization, but several elements of the website's design and content encourage the position that gun deaths are problematic and perhaps avoidable:</p>
        <div class="section group">
           <div class="col span_1_of_2">
               <h3>CONTENT</h3>
               <li>Lives ended by gun death are referred to as "stolen"</li>
               <li>The visualization summarizes the total years of 'stolen life' due to gun deaths in the USA as a single number </li>
               <li><i>What This Data Reveals </i> section refers to disproportionate impact on males and young people. The interactive features would have allowed the user to discover this on their own, but it is presented as a default. </li>
          </div>

          <div class="col span_1_of_2">
              <h3>DESIGN</h3>
              <li>Individual lives are represented as arcs in the inforgraphic, evoking the long arc of a life and lived experience</li>
              <li>Arcs of individual gun death victims are filled gray when the individual died, suggesting a loss or a 'stealing' of life </li>
              <li>All gun death arcs are represented cumulatively, giving a sense of the volume of 'stolen' life </li>

            </div>
          </div>
   		 <h3>Does it achieve everything it set out to do?</h3>
    		<p>No.</p>
    		<p>When using the filter system, the curves for the selected demographic move above the axis and all other victims move below. The quantity of curves does not appear to be accurately correlated, visually, to the percentages of victims on display.</p>

            <h3>CONS</h3>
             <ol>
                <li><p>No legend to explain the gradient yellow color of the curves (we suspect it's to make the overlapping curves legible, but it's not actually explained):</p>

                 </li>
                <li>Difficult to compare the graphs among different filters to reach further conclusions.
                 </li>
                <li>Ambiguous and loaded words like "People Killed" and "Stolen Years" doesn't explain difference between 2010 dataset (homicides) and 2013 dataset (suicides & homicides).
