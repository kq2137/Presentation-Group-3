To do: 
- decide on a project: U.S Gun Deaths
- gather information about the project:	
* What is this project trying to achieve/description? This project is trying to achieve an accurate depiction of the lives lost due to gun violence throughout the U.S, and the amount of years that each victim, and society, lost due to gun violence. We need more. - Simon
* What data is it using? How did they get that data? How did they process it?
    * The origin of the data for 2010 is the FBIâ€™s Uniform Crime Report, which utilizes data from police precincts from throughout the U.S that was voluntarily reported. This information includes the demographics (age, gender, race, relationship to killer, etc.) of the victims. The 2013 data was collected by the federal government, and also included Twitter data surrounding gun deaths. - Mad
